# AethOS

AethOS is a ubiquitous, private, distributed OS.

The main goals of AethOS is personal freedom and independence.

Freedom comes from the ability to use AethOS anywhere as your main operating system, with all of the benefits of cloud / web based technology, but with the added independence of self hosting.

## Ubiquitous

Ubiquitous, in this sense, means "everywhere".  When you install AethOS on your computers and devices, you can run your AethOS apps anywhere and everywhere.

You can use any modern web browser to access your desktop.  You can work offline or online, and you can work remotely or locally.  AethOS takes care of the syncronization.

Connecting AethOS to your IoT devices allow you to seamlessly control your world.

## Private

When you have a device with a microphone or camera and you want to enable gesture recognition and voice recognition, or when you wear bio sensors to monitor your heartrate, temperature, etc, you don't want that data being sent to some corporate controlled cloud, do you?

The answer to "always on" voice recognition and gesture recognition isn't to give up your privacy.  The answer is to keep control of your data.

As technology advances, one of the things that should concern us the most is having our own private, secure, personal space.  When posession is 90% of the law, what happens when everything is in the "cloud" and we don't have posession of anything?

The AethOS answer is simple.  Run everything on hardware you control, and the data stays in your posession.

## Distributed

With the AethOS distributed file system and JBOC (just a bunch of computers) cluster management, you can combine all of the power of your existing equipment into a single loosly coupled cluster.

Securely share processing and storage resources among all of the computers in your networkThe AethOS container technology allows you to share resources without sacrificing security or privacy.

Network splits are handled automatically.  Unplug your laptop, and take your work with you.  Syncronize online, or use AethOS offline and synchronize when you're reconnected.

## Apps

AethOS apps run in secure sandbox containers, which means that you control the permissions for each app.

With the software catalog, you can easily find and install new apps.  With the open architecture, you can download and install other apps from the Internet, or create your own apps and share / sell them as you wish.

## No advertising

AethOS software catalog does not allow any advertising, either within the apps, or inside the catalog itself.  All apps and developers are treated equally, with user contributed reviews and ratings.
