## AethOS

AethOS is an extremely flexible, lightweight Cloud OS, running on top of Node.js; it can be run on cloud based VM's such as Amazons EC2 compute nodes, on private clouds, on standard web servers (containers, VM's or iron), on a JBOC (Just a Bunch of Computers) cluster, or it can be run on a configuration using a combination of these choices.
