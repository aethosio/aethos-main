# AethOS

AethOS is a ubiquitous, private, secure OS.

## Ubiquitous

Ubiquitous, in this sense, means "everywhere".  When you install AethOS on your computer(s), and you install remote viewer apps on your devices (phone, TV / settop box, tablet, laptop), you can run your AethOS apps anywhere and everywhere.  

AethOS connected devices allow you to seamlessly control your world.

## Secure and Private

When you have a device with a microphone or camera installed in your home to support gesture recognition and voice recognition, or when you wear bio sensors to monitor your heartrate, temperature, etc, you don't want that data being sent to some corporate controlled cloud, do you?

The answer to "always on" voice recognition and gesture recognition isn't to give up your privacy.  The answer is to keep control of your data.

As technology advances, one of the things that should concern us the most is having our own private, secure, personal space.  When posession is 90% of the law, what happens when everything is in the "cloud" and we don't have posession of anything?

The AethOS answer is simple.  Run everything on hardware you control, and the data stays secure.

## Clustering

With the AethOS distributed file system and JBOC (just a bunch of computers) cluster management, you can combine power of your existing equipment into one AetherNet based cluster.

Have some extra CPU / GPU power available?  Or do you need some extra?  Team up with a group of people and securely share processing and storage resources.  The AethOS container technology allows you to share resources without sacrificing security or privacy.

## Apps

AethOS apps run in secure sandbox containers, which means that you control the permissions for each app.

With the software catalog, you can easily find and install new apps.  With the open architecture, you can download and install other apps from the Internet, or create your own apps and share / sell them as you wish.

## No advertising

AethOS software catalog does not allow any advertising, either within the apps, or inside the catalog itself.  All apps and developers are treated equally, with user contributed reviews and ratings.
